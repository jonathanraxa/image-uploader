# Time to Complete

~ 9 hours

# What I Didn't Finish (nice to have)

- Multiple image upload
- Pagination
- Page limits
- DB (storage is created on the fly via Node)
- Tag metadata (or more filter options) for images when searching

# Note (for transparency)

- Since I have never touched Node professionaally, AI was used for Node. I understand this may be an issue so I am okay
