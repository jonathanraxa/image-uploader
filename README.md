# Time to Complete

~ 9 hours

# If Given More Time (nice to have)...

- Multiple image uploading
- Pagination
- Page limits
- DB (storage is created on the fly as an array of metadata objects via Node, and it's a bit wonky)
- Tag metadata (or more filter options) for images when searching
- Deleting images could have confirmation modals (ie. "Are you sure?")

# A note for transparency

- Since I have never touched Node professionally (some personally more recently), and I didn't want to mock the API, I used some research and AI to help me create the CRUD functions with Express.
